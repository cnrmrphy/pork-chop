## Conversations

We use [ChatterBot](https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot), a machine learning conversational dialog engine to power Pork Chop's conversations.

### Training

Pork Chop has a few options for training:
* Train with csv data - The success and training time with this is dependent on the size and quality of the data you provide it. For reference, a 70,000 message file we trained pork chop with took around 10 minutes on a AWS EC2 t3.micro VM. See [example_training.csv](./example_training.csv) for reference.
* Train with english corpus - Train with the small english corpus provided by ChatterBot
* Train with Ubuntu corpus - This is a huge data set which will take a long time to download and train

## Command Modules

Pork chop will respond to the following command modules:
* !example - Template module
* !usage - Display modules and their use
* !kanye - Display a random Kanye West quote.
* !stonks \<symbol\> - Get stock price information
* !turn \<user\> [list] - Turn a user or list number of turns for all users
* !helpmecook \<food\> - Get recipe help for cooking a tasty vegan meal with spoonacular api (try cooking manwich)
* !yt \<query\> - Get the best-match YouTube video url for your query
* !reddit \<query\> - Get the best-match subreddit for your query
